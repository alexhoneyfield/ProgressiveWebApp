start class names with the name of the file with no capitals and use hyphens for spaces
e.g. for the file "CameraView.js" you would use the text "camera-view"

after the file name prefix use a double underscore "__" to delimit then use a string to represent
what elements the class is for. Use hyphens for spaces and don't use capitals.

If the elements the class is for have any modifiers then use another double underscore to delimit
and use another string to represent what the modifier is.

The format should look like this: file-name__class-use__modifier
e.g. camera-view__camera-preview__portrait

This should help avoid problems with class name duplications and other bugs.
